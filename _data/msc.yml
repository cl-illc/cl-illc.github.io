    This is a course about multilinguality and machine translation where we cover:

    * Unsupervised word alignments: directed models (EM estimation and VB) and undirected models (MLE via gradient-based optimisation)
    * Statistical machine translation: (hierarchical) phrase-based MT (linear models), latent-variable CRF for hierarhical PBSMT
    * Neural machine translation: fully supervised sequence to sequence models, deep generative models
